# flickr-feed-search
This is a simple and pure ReactJS site that instantly pulls data from Flickr's public feed, then dynamically searches through the images

Also note that due to Flickr's policies, CORS must be enabled on the client side. To guarantee this easily, install this Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
